Eloquent Javascript

Eloquent Javascript for practice exercises for Mod-1 Madison Kerndt.

Description

This repository will serve as the living space for all of the practice problems, exercises and lessons that are associated with the Eloquent Javascript book. Eloquent Javascript was written by Marijn Haverbeke and was published in 2011. This book serves as a resource material for a Module 1 front-end engineering course offered by Turing School for Code and Design. The book offers a variety of instruction types including explanations, follow-along projects, and exercises at the end of each chapter. As noted earlier this repository will act as the holding space for the the projects, exercises, and tutorials presented in Eloquent Javascript. Therefore may of the documents will be lettered with questions and note, please disregard. It is all part of the learning process and I hope you enjoy peering into my muddled mind as I parse though and begin to understand Eloquent Javascript.

Chapter 6 & 7

Included in this repository is the practice problem from chapter 7, exemplifying many of the concepts described in chapter 6. The project consisted of creating a 2D simulated world, complete with barriers, creatures, and actions. This project focused on the use of objects and prototypes along with other complementary topics.

The purpose of important blocks of code are indicated by comments written in all capital letters. All other comments are questions or comments as I made as I worked though the presented problem.

As you can see from the abundance of questions included in the project write up I have an understanding of the concepts presented in chapter 6 along with a marginal grasp of the purpose for each line of code written in the project. That being said, I fell as though my capacity for application, at this point, is lacking. I have many questions around syntax and some of the methods used in this example.

I found this project very beneficial to my learning as I followed along and rewrote the program. I am eager to persist and continue learning about this complex and intriguing topic.
